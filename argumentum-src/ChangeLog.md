# Changelog

## [0.3.0]

### Added

- It is now possible to add an instantiated instance of CommandOptions with `add_command`.  This
  makes it easier to access global options from within command options.  See the test
  shouldAccessParentOptionsFromCommand in `command_t.cpp` and the new example in the README file.
- The help formatter can be changed in parser configuration. See the test shouldChangeHelpFormatter
  in `parserconfig_t.cpp`.

### Changed

- The interface for defining program parameters has changed.  The parameters are defined through the
  `params()` method of the `argument_parser` class.  The old `argument_parser` methods for defining
  parameters are deprecated and will be removed.
- Fix: Treat negative numbers as numbers when they can not be mistaken for options.

## [Next]

### Added

- It is possible to collect parameters that will be forwarded to a subprocess.  The syntax is
  similar to the one used in GCC.
- Multiple names can be defined for meta-varaiables in `metavar()` by specifying a list of strings
  instead of a simple string.
